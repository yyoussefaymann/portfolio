      <h3>Youssef Abdelmoamen</h3>
      <p>I'm a 19 year old egyptian who doesn't really have a history with programming, but
        in foundation year I learned Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and thankfully I excelled 
        in them and the other subjects and was amongst the top 3 who took a scholarship to City.
        unfortunately, it has been a long time since I practiced them.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Slideshow project (Juice WRLD)</h3>
    <p>My first attempt at a programming project after the two week bootcamp 2020.
      my project displays broad understanding of images, sounds, arrays, and conditionals.
      I designed and created a slideshow about my favourite rapper where it contains exactly 5 slides 
      each with a 900x500 picture of him in addition to simple text in each slide. You could flip
      through the slides either by clicking the mouse, pressing the right arrow, or just waiting and the
      slide will flip automatically. on the other hand if you want to go to the previous slide just press the
      left arrow. in addition, using the tint() function the slides fade into each other in a smooth manner.
      Finally while watching the slideshow and reading the simple information written, Juice WRLD's 
      most famous song 'Lucid Dreams' will be playing.

    <h3>Programming for Java 2021: 2D game project (Naruto)</h3>
    <p>My first attempt at a programming game.
        It is a simple game where the character has to collect all the ramen and regroup with his friend.
        This project proved to me that you are capable of far more than you think,
        for anyone watching it might seem like a simple basic game but for me it is far more.
        It proved that I could do anything if I put in the work, and for this project I did but I faced some personal emergencies that got in the way of me doing the best I can unfortanetly. However, I'm proud of what I reached and more importantly learned and hopefully next time I will do the absolute best.
